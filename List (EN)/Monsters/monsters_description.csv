Relatively docile herbivores with characteristic crest plates. They form herds and raise young commu- nally, and have been used as pack animals for generations; their meat is tasty and nutritious. Very cautious around large monsters.
Small herbivores known for their gentle demeanor. Kelbi horns are effective against various dis- eases, but recent research has shown the animal must be kept alive to harvest quality material. Thus, they must be stunned first.
Submissive, water-dwelling herbivores that subsist on water grasses and moss. Epioth surface frequently to sunbathe. Extremely timid, they panic when danger is near, swimming about in haphazard fashion.
Herd-forming herbivores. Covered in thick fur to endure the cold. Popo are gentle, but known to use their massive tusks bravely when defending their young. Popo meat is very nutritious; the tongue is said to be especially palatable.
Flying insects that inhabit most environments. They attack invaders with a paralyzing poison, and lay eggs in carrion together with a body fluid that hastens decompo- sition. Attracted to light, they will gather around any fire.
Insects that widely inhabit many areas. Noted for absorbing fruit, mushrooms and honey, then carrying them back to the nest. Materials can thus be collected from their swollen abdomens, whose color is related to what is being carried.
Bipedal creatures resembling cats, known for their light hair. Though usually docile, they will attack viciously if provoked. Naturally curious, some try to enter human society. Fond of Felvine, they will follow its scent anywhere.
Bipedal creatures resembling cats, known for their dark hair. More curious than Felynes and possessed by kleptomania, Melynxes take what they steal back to their dens. Felvine intoxicates them, causing them to sometimes drop items.
This category includes carnivorous fish (Sharq, Catfish), migratory fish (Tuna, Arowanas), and nata- torial fish (Molids, Perciformes). Fish often flee when attacked, so hunters prefer to use harpoons to obtain materials from them.
Wyvern larvae. Remarkably fecund, they can survive in any dark envi- ronment. Giggi are sensitive to light and heat, and hence will avoid torches. They are also known to leech blood from other animals, converting it into toxins.
Highly social, carnivorous bird wyverns that live in large packs. Young Jaggi males hunt in groups, attacking much larger animals. Current research suggests they operate under orders from an alpha male. Aggressive but wary of fire.
Female Jaggi that stay in groups, Jaggia generally cluster around the nest to defend it and raise whelps. Smaller than mature males, but larger and tougher than the countless young males. Jaggia also operate under an alpha's orders.
Highly intelligent, carnivorous bird wyverns that hunt in packs. Noted for their blue scales and sharp glare. Baggi are feared for their ability to secrete a tran- quilizing fluid, which can knock even humans out for a few seconds.
Aquatic female monsters. Ludroth form "harems" around large males, gathering in territories designated as breeding grounds. They're known to be extremely aggressive towards outsiders; caution is advised.
Leviathans that inhabit volcanoes. Noted for swarming around larger monsters' kills in order to feed. Uroktor rarely hunt for them- selves, but stab upwards at prey from the ground when they do. Known for being highly aggressive.
Carnivorous monsters that inhabit deserts. Delex always travel in schools of five or six. When near large monsters on the hunt, they will attempt to surround the prey and scavenge feed. Known to flee if other Delex are injured.
Extremely territorial herbivores with poor vision, but acute hear- ing. Rhenoplos will doggedly pur- sue any nearby target they sense. They often collide into boulders, perhaps because they cannot easily stop once they begin to run.
The commanding alpha male of Jaggi packs. Most males leave the group upon reaching maturity, returning later to compete with others. The dominant male then becomes a Great Jaggi. Apparently, they can issue fairly complex orders via howling.
Carnivorous bird wyverns like the Jaggi. Noted for their projecting cranial crests and bluish-white skin that's adapted to snow. Great Baggi craftily command other Baggi to surround their prey and stun them with a tranquilizing fluid.
Barroth usually remain beneath the mud, perhaps to shield themselves from heat; they are even known to attack by flinging mud. They will charge in a frenzy at anything that disturbs their bogs.
Brute wyverns that feed on ore, using their mighty jaws to crush bedrock to powder. They cleverly affix rocks and ore to their hides with lava, then cast them about, using vibrations to make them ex- plode. Will sometimes drop ore.
Bird wyverns with unique plumage. Well known for using their thoracic vocal organs to imitate other monsters' calls, first summoning them, then using the distraction to flee. Spits a dangerous combustible body fluid.
Fire-breathing female wyverns, also known as the "Queens of the Land". With powerful legs and poison-secreting tails, they hunt mainly on the ground. Sometimes seen preying as a couple, Rathian cooperate well with Rathalos.
Terrible wyverns called the "Kings of the Skies". Together with Rath- ian, they stake wide territories centered around their nests. Rath- alos descend on invaders from the sky, attacking with poison claws and breath of fire.
Wyverns feared as desert tyrants. Extremely territorial, Diablos attack invaders with blind  aggression. Highly sensitive to sound, perhaps because they frequently travel beneath the sand. Known to feed on cacti.
Wyverns that inhabit the Tundra. Known to stun prey with poison, then freeze the meat in caves. Gigginox live in darkness and thus have degraded vision; they detect prey through body heat. Extremely fertile, laying innumerable eggs.
Wyverns that rule the eternally frozen Tundra. Barioth use their huge tusks and spiked scales to move freely atop the slippery ice; this ability makes them very difficult to keep up with.
Royal Ludroth use their sponge- like neck scales to absorb water and prevent drying out on land. Once the sponge loses moisture, they attempt to re-enter the water. They also spew mucus to trip up their pray. 
Monsters with strong camouflage skills and powerful neurotoxins. Poor swimmers, Gobul conceal themselves and lure prey by imitating plants with their barbels. Can reportedly swallow Epioth whole. They love frogs.
Known as sea wyverns, Lagiacrus are at the top of the aquatic food chain. Feared by sailors as the "Lords of the Seas", they store enough electricity in their spinal organs to make the oceans surge. Occasionally seen resting on land.
Also known as fire-pike wyverns, Agnaktor use their tough beaks and great strength to burrow through rock, and sometimes even cave ceilings. Encrusted with hardened lava that can soften from the heat when they burrow or spit magma.
Legendary elder dragons known as both "shining giants of the depths" and "great sea dragons." Not confirmed to exist until re- cently. The Moga quakes were due to a Ceadeus butting its abnor- mally long horns into the earth.
The dreaded, nomadic Deviljho have no specific territory of their own. Their muscles swell if provoked, revealing old wounds. Needing to feed constantly due to high body heat, they can hunt nearby animals to extinction.
Rare ore can be mined from these enormous dragons' backs; thus they are considered prosperity symbols. They swallow vast amounts of organic material and are always surrounded by scavenging Delex, which sailors use to locate them.
Blazing black dragons, so named for resembling both lightning and darkness. They mercilessly tear apart whoever touches their sharp scales. Elementally unstable, their actions can affect the very weather. Living natural disasters.
